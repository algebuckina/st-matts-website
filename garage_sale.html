    <p>The garage sale has been suspended indefinitely, please come back later for more information. <br> They are normally held several times a year and many men and women from St. Matthew’s join together to prepare donated goods and set up for the sale
        on a Saturday which brings many people from the wider community. The funds raised are used to further the mission objectives of St. Matthew’s.</p>
