    <p>Please look out for advertising for our next Large Garage Sale. They are normally held several times a year and many men and women from St. Matthew’s join together to prepare donated goods and set up for the sale on a Saturday which brings many people
        from the wider community. The funds raised are used to further the mission objectives of St. Matthew’s.</p>
