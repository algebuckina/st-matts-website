    <p class="added">Alive used to be our Friday night highschool age youthgroup, but as the attendees have matured, so has Alive. Alive now meets fortnightly with a more casual approach to nights, ranging from outings to the city, to painting at the Church.</p>
    <p>To quote one of the organisers, "We have matured like cheese, we may be older, but we really haven't changed."</p>
