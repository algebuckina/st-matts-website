        <dd class="added">

            <p>c. In retirement facilities</p>
        </dd>
        <dd class="added">

        <dd class="added">
            <p>e. By phone, particularly during times of Covid lockdowns</p>
        </dd>
        <dt class="added"><p>2.	When visiting I endeavour to engage people in their journey through life. This can be events in the recent or distant past. We even try to glimpse into the future.</p></dt>
        <dt class="added"><p>3.	Link with families in the event of a death. This may also involve participation in the funeral (thanksgiving) service. I also follow up with families after the funeral for a while.</p></dt>
        <dt class="added"><p>4.	Following Communion Services at St Matthews’ I take communion to interested people who are not able to attend physically at St Matthews’ Church. Sometimes this is 1:1 and sometimes I have a number of people gather together for the opportunity.</p></dt>
        <dt class="added"><p>5.	I participate occasionally in combined worship held in Retirement Villages. This is by invitation from an organizer at the village.</p></dt>
