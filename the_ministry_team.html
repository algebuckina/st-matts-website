    <h2>Mike Strong</h2>
    <h3>Pastoral Carer for Seniors</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Some of the things I do are:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt class="added">
            <p>1. Visit people</p>
        </dt>
        <dd class="added">
            <p>a. At home when invited in</p>
        </dd>
        <dd class="added">
            <p>b. At home at the door when people are more comfortable with this sort of personal interaction</p>
        </dd>
        <dd class="added">
            <p>c. In retirement facilities</p>
        </dd>
        <dd class="added">
            <p>d. in hospitals and/or rehab centres when this is possible</p>
        </dd>
        <dd class="added">
            <p>e. By phone, particularly during times of Covid lockdowns</p>
        </dd>
        <dt class="added">
            <p>2. When visiting I endeavour to engage people in their journey through life. This can be events in the
                recent or distant past. We even try to glimpse into the future.</p>
        </dt>
        <dt class="added">
            <p>3. Link with families in the event of a death. This may also involve participation in the funeral
                (thanksgiving) service. I also follow up with families after the funeral for a while.</p>
        </dt>
        <dt class="added">
            <p>4. Following Communion Services at St Matthews’ I take communion to interested people who are not able to
                attend physically at St Matthews’ Church. Sometimes this is 1:1 and sometimes I have a number of people
                gather together for the opportunity.</p>
        </dt>
        <dt class="added">
            <p>5. I participate occasionally in combined worship held in Retirement Villages. This is by invitation from
                an organizer at the village.</p>
        </dt>
