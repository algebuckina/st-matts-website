    <p class="added">The Seniors ministry exists for the Seniors in the Church and wider community, to have a safe and welcoming place for fellowship, ministry and friendship. In addition, itâ€™s about caring for the seniors and those that cannot get out to activities.
        We are most grateful to our team of volunteers who network out to our seniors in the community with visitations, sending cards, phone calls and organising transport.</p>
