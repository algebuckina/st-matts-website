        The St Matthews Soccer Club started in 1977 and since then has provided the game of soccer to boy's and girls of all ages within the core atmosphere of good fellowship. Over recent years our junior club has dropped but we are still here to provide the
        game of soccer within the church family and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>We are always looking to welcome new members to the club, whether that be players or admin/support. If you are interested or have any questions please contact Jeff Cuff 0466825190</p>

    <h3>Yearly Overview</h3>

        Cup. <br>• 2021 saw significant player movement and injuries deplete numbers, resulting in St Matthews forming a combined Premier League squad with Greystanes Churches. The competition was abandoned in June due to the COVID lockdown.
