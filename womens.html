    <p class="added">St Matthew’s Women’s Fellowship Group meets on the second Wednesday of each month, February to December, from 10 am to 12 noon.</p>
    <p class="added">It is a warm and friendly group where enjoyment of fellowship and caring for one another are important values. </p>
    <p class="added">The meeting includes a short devotion presented by one of the ladies followed by an activity such as, a visiting speaker, sharing of life experiences or holiday trips or a fun activity of a quiz or board games to name a few; morning tea is also a
        welcome inclusion. Through the years many fundraising events have enabled donations to be made for items needed by the church and for many areas of mission support.</p>
    <p class="added">A meaningful and much appreciated ministry of the Women’s Fellowship is catering for refreshments following Thanksgiving services.</p>
    <p class="added">There is always a warm, welcoming invitation to any ladies and their friends to share together in this group.</p>
